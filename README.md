# 2023 HD Mountains Mexican Spotted Owl Project
## Purpose of this site
This site is intended to provide public access to information about the project including documentation of ARU preparation, field methods, and data analysis using Raven Pro software.
## Introduction
The 2023 HD Mountains Mexican Spotted Owl (HD-MSO-2023) project was launched in early 2023 to determine whether the Mexican Spotted Owl is present in the Bull Creek drainage of the HD Mountains south of Chimney Rock, Colorado. Four autonomous recording units (ARUs) were installed along the Bull Creak ATV trail and programmed to record between sunset and sunrise. Recordings were analyzed using Raven Pro software to detect the presence of Mexican Spotted Owl vocalizations.
